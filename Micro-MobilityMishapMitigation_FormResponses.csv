It is a hilly, bumpy, grassy land, with narrow pathways for walking. Riding a scooter around at a high velocity could endanger the people who are trying to walk around. I don't blame people for wanting to ride scooters - these devices are fast and convenient. However, Berkeley has really shit infrastructure for supporting scooter usage. I hope we can lobby for better infrastructure such that bikers and scooter users can more safely co-exist with walkers!!!"
